# Service/Schema Description

This service provides access to traffic and object counting data derived from Glasgow City Council (GCC) camera systems. <br>
The data was created in collaboration between the **Urban Big Data Centre (UBDC)** and **Glasgow City Council**, and is currently operated and maintained by GCC.

#### Data Generation

The underlying data is generated through machine learning workflows that process live video feeds from GCC's camera network. These ML models detect and count various objects of interest including:

- Bicycles
- Lorries
- Cars
- Other vehicles and objects
