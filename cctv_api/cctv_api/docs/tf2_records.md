
# TensorFlow v2 Records

## Overview

TensorFlow v2 records are generated by machine learning models built using TensorFlow version 2. These records represent detection or prediction results produced by the ML model during inference.

## Confidence Threshold

- **Minimum Confidence Level**: 50% (0.5)
- Only predictions with a confidence score of 50% or higher are included in the records
- This threshold ensures reliability by filtering out low-confidence detections
