
# YOLO Records

## Overview

YOLO records are detection results generated by the YOLO (You Only Look Once) machine learning model. These records contain information about objects detected in video frames.

## Confidence Threshold

- **Minimum Confidence Level**: 50% (0.5)
- Only predictions with a confidence score of 50% or higher are included in the records
- This threshold ensures reliability by filtering out low-confidence detections
